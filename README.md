# Byte64 OS

Byte64 OS is a 64-bit x86_64 operating system written from scratch in C and a little assembly. This project is still under progress.

## A Brief Overview

Byte64 OS started as a passion project and remains a work in progress. It is designed for learning and experimentation rather than practical use, as it is far from complete or stable.

## Compiling the Source

To compile the source code, execute the `make` command in the parent directory:

```
make
```

This will generate an ISO file and start QEMU. You may need to update the compiler path and other settings in the scripts to suit your environment.
